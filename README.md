# Scramjet Subsystem – Propulsion Final Project

This repository documents the development of a conceptual scramjet engine for a hypersonic vehicle as part of an academic propulsion design project. It includes performance modeling, thermodynamic cycle analysis, flowpath development, and system integration considerations.

## 🚀 Project Objective

Design and analyze a scramjet propulsion system capable of sustaining hypersonic flight (Mach 5+) using ideal and quasi-realistic models. Document design constraints, performance trade-offs, and system-level impact.

## 🧪 Key Analyses

- Ideal Brayton cycle for scramjet engine
- Fuel-air ratio and combustion temperature estimation
- Flowpath sizing: inlet, isolator, combustor, nozzle
- Total pressure recovery and expansion efficiency
- Mission-level implications (specific thrust, TSFC)

## 🔧 Tools Used

- MATLAB for thermodynamic modeling
- NASA CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) for combustion
- Python (optional) for plotting and parametric sweeps
- LaTeX/Word for report writing
