# ✅ To-Do List – Scramjet Subsystem

---

## 🔧 Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Create GitHub repository  
- [x] Link VS Code to GitHub repo  
- [x] Define folder structure (`docs/`, `analysis/`, `figures/`, etc.)  
- [x] Upload this TO‑DO list and README  

---

## 📘 Background & Theory
- [x] Summarize scramjet operating principles in `docs/02_Scramjet_Analysis.md`  
- [ ] List pros and cons of hydrogen vs. hydrocarbon fuels  
- [x] Document key thermodynamic assumptions (ideal gas, steady state)  

---

## 🧪 Analysis & Modeling
- [x] Define flight conditions: Mach 6–8, cruise altitude ≈ 84 000 ft  
- [x] Perform ideal “Farokhi” cycle analysis (`scram_cycle.m`)  
- [x] Estimate specific thrust, Isp, and fuel–air ratio  
- [x] Run dynamic‑pressure check for q ≈ 1000–1500 psf  
- [x] Size inlet (3‑shock), combustor (T₄=2220 K), and nozzle (NPR→Ae/At)  
- [x] Optimize 3‑shock inlet angles for worst‑case recovery  

---

## 📐 Geometry & Flowpath
- [ ] Create schematic of scramjet components in `figures/`  
- [ ] Estimate flow area ratios and section lengths  
- [ ] Annotate with static pressure and temperature distributions  

---

## 📈 Results & Documentation
- [x] Plot inlet recovery vs. Mach (baseline & optimized)  
- [ ] Plot T‑s diagram of cycle  
- [ ] Plot parametric sweep (Mach vs. Isp or TSFC)  
- [x] Write performance summary in `docs/02_Scramjet_Analysis.md`  

---

## 📤 Report & Submission
- [ ] Draft propulsion section of team report integrating scramjet data  
- [ ] Submit diagrams, tables, and figures to team repo  
- [ ] Coordinate with rocket‐stage team for integration timeline
